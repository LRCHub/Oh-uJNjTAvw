```lrc
[00:01.40] Yeah, yeah, 1-2, 1-2
[00:04.17] Y'all know what this is, man
[00:05.54] Turn your fuckin' volume up
[00:07.07] Yo, yo, ay, come on, listen
[00:09.99] I said
[00:10.56] Time to get creative, y'all know coffee is the drug of choice
[00:13.24] Knockin' all them sloppy demons off me just to hush the noise
[00:15.83] Bless my inner child, spoiled rotten with a bunch of toys
[00:18.47] This the opposite of muscles poppin' from a ton of 'roids
[00:21.47] Natural growth, the Mack took a oath
[00:23.40] To leave no gaps in the practice of the raps that he wrote
[00:25.99] Every chapter masterfully crafted, dawg, it has to be dope
[00:28.63] His dreams, fastened to hope, schemеs act as the rope
[00:31.51] Sharp bars off the domе, throwin' darts from the melon
[00:34.34] If the art is compelling then your heart will start swelling
[00:36.99] Expanding with love, get high like cannabis buds
[00:39.30] Candle lit up, I'm just hoping y'all can handle the buzz
[00:41.98] Because admittedly, it's almost too much to take
[00:44.74] Utilizing raw truth just to hush the fakes
[00:47.27] We keep it authentic 'til the end of time
[00:49.91] I send a blend of rhymes, beats bending spines
[00:52.72] It goes deep
[00:53.92] Every time I grab the mic
[00:55.62] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[00:58.02] It goes deep
[00:59.20] When I start explorin' a verse
[01:00.92] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[01:03.31] Yeah, it goes deep
[01:04.57] Every time I grab the mic
[01:06.26] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[01:08.77] It goes deep
[01:09.82] When I start explorin' a verse
[01:11.54] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[01:13.94] Yeah, it goes deep
[01:14.64] I don't need motivation, all I need is a routine
[01:16.84] To focus on creatin' instead of shiftin' to new scenes
[01:19.53] Swifter with the verses like floor from Swiffer, they too clean
[01:22.30] Addicted to the process of painting pictures, a true fiend
[01:24.90] Miles David on Blue in Green, ill melodic phrasing
[01:27.83] Caught a sensation that's hot and blazin'
[01:29.57] While jottin' all these thought creations
[01:31.01] If it's not authentic then I'm not relating
[01:33.05] Pause the philosophical postulating, yo, stop debating
[01:36.09] I'm clearly the sickest, the lyrical misfit
[01:37.93] They feel me when they hearin' me spit
[01:39.44] This is merely a tidbit
[01:40.65] It goes deeper than regions over which Poseidon presidin'
[01:43.32] In fact deeper than black holes suckin' the light in
[01:46.15] Deeper than that addiction to the rush of excitement the drugs are providing
[01:49.81] Deeper than the crushing depression
[01:51.27] Deeper than rock bottom, deeper than the love that you finding
[01:53.93] From a friend that's hugging you tight without no judgment inside him
[01:56.75] It goes deep
[01:57.84] Every time I grab the mic
[01:59.77] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[02:01.97] It goes deep
[02:03.18] When I start explorin' a verse
[02:05.07] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[02:07.29] Yeah, it goes deep
[02:08.46] Every time I grab the mic
[02:10.10] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[02:12.62] It goes deep
[02:13.83] When I start explorin' a verse
[02:15.42] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[02:17.84] Yeah, it goes deep
[02:18.56] I said I'm cracking the surface, I'm rapping with purpose
[02:20.90] Any distraction, I curb this, I’m attacking these verses
[02:23.39] With a vengeance
[02:24.09] So unrelenting with my craft as a wordsmith
[02:25.99] It has to be perfect
[02:27.08] When we in the lab and we workin’
[02:28.78] It’s similar to pastors in churches
[02:30.33] The passion is palpable
[02:31.83] More than the cash that you stashin’
[02:32.91] It's massively valuable
[02:34.41] Molded from molten, hot, malleable materials
[02:36.68] The incalculable power alchemy leads to miracles
[02:39.66] This is not rap, it's a offering to God
[02:42.49] Strip away the artificial, off with the façade
[02:45.12] Condition critical, emcees are put up in the ER
[02:48.30] Energy received through these bars
[02:50.34] Effortless rhythm, entities regard
[02:52.28] Every rhyme as heavenly
[02:54.07] I'm forever gon' climb to the very peak
[02:56.10] They sayin' Harry's weak, they trippin'
[02:57.92] Make you aware of secrets that's buried deep so listen
[03:00.75] It goes deep
[03:01.88] Every time I grab the mic
[03:03.59] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[03:05.96] It goes deep
[03:07.13] When I start explorin' a verse
[03:08.94] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[03:11.16] Yeah, it goes deep
[03:12.36] Every time I grab the mic
[03:14.24] You probably feel this shit off in the afterlife
[03:16.54] It goes deep
[03:17.81] When I start explorin' a verse
[03:19.56] I burn mo'fuckers like the core of the earth
[03:21.85] Yeah, it goes deep
